# Spotify Library Manager

This is a project that I want to make to manage my spotify libraries.

## The Problem

I have a lot of songs in my spotify library, and I want to manage them easier.  
With almost 100 playlists, it's hard to find a song that I want to listen to or to find the good playlist to add a song.
Most of the time, I can't find the playlist that I want to add a song to.
So I want to create a tool that will help me to manage my spotify libraries.

## The Solution

I want to create a tool that will help me to manage my spotify libraries.
This tool will be able to:
- List all the songs in my library
- List all the playlists
- Add a song to a playlist
- Remove a song from a playlist
- Create a playlist
- Delete a playlist
- Search for a song in my library
- Search for a playlist
- List all the songs in a playlist
- List all the playlists that a song is in
- List all the songs that are in a playlist
- Create directories to organize my playlist (actually spotify have directories but it's very limited, for example albums can't be in a directory)
